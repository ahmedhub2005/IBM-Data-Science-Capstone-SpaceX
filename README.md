# IBM-Data-Science-Capstone-SpaceX
This is my completed Applied Data Science Capstone Project from the final course in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. This capstone project course will gave me the chance to practice the work that data scientists do when working with datasets.

In this course I assumed the role of a Data Scientist working for a startup intending to compete with SpaceX, and in the process followed the Data Science methodology involving data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and reporting results to stakeholders.

I was tasked with predicting if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. With the help of my data Science findings and models, the competing startup I was hired by was able to make more informed bids against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

This course focused on hands-on work to demonstrate and apply what I learned in previous IBM Data Science courses.
